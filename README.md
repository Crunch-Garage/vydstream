# 📒 Project Model

Vydstream is an app that enables people to access and stream top-rated movies and TV shows instantly just like NetFlix build with <b>Expo</b> and  <b>React Native</b>.

This is a concept app that we designed and built for demonstration purposes and to inspire the development and design community.

The demo app is available for download for Android, UI-Designs, and the source code is also open-sourced (Links Below this Post).

However, we do offer custom product and software design services on request. So feel free to reach out to us If you'd like us to build for you a fully featured video app or UI-Kit based on this design or a completely new design.

Also reach out if you'd want us to add a feature this design.
